SW_Model.c
08/26/2009	(drs) stricmp -> strcmp
SW_Output.c
08/26/2009	(drs) stricmp -> strcmp -> Str_CompareI;
			in SW_OUT_sum_today () added 'break;' after 'default: '
09/09/2009	(drs) strcmp -> Str_CompareI (not case-sensitive)
SW_VegEstabl.c
08/26/2009	(drs) added 'return;' after 'LBL_Normal_Exit:'


Fixed miscellaneous bugs:

SW_Output.c
08/27/2009	(drs) changed output-strings str[12] to #define OUTSTRLEN 18; str[OUTSTRLEN]; because of sprintf(str, ...) overflow and memory corruption into for-index i 
09/15/2009	(drs) wetdays output was not working: changed in get_wetdays() the output from sprintf(fmt, "%c%%3.0f", _Sep); to sprintf(str, "%c%i", _Sep, val);
10/13/2009	(drs) output period of static void get_swcm(void) was erroneously set to eSW_SWP instead of eSW_SWCM
SW_Weather.c
20090916	(drs) changed  in SW_WTH_new_day() the following code:
				wn->temp_avg[Today]     = (tmpmax + tmpmin) / 2.;
				to wn->temp_avg[Today]     = (wn->temp_max[Today] + wn->temp_min[Today]) / 2.;
				such that monthly scaling factors also influence average T and not only Tmin and Tmax
Times.c (v6)
03/12/2010	(drs) "365:366" --> Time_get_lastdoy_y(TimeInt year) {return isleapyear(year) ? 366 : 365; }
SW_Model.c
03/12/2010	(drs) "DAYLAST_NORTH [==366]  : DAYLAST_SOUTH;" --> "m->endend = (m->isnorth) ? Time_get_lastdoy_y(m->endyr)  : DAYLAST_SOUTH;"
Sky.c (v8)
06/16/2010	(drs) all cloud.in input files contain on line 1 cloud cover, line 2 wind speed, line 3 rel. humidity, and line 4 transmissivity, but SW_SKY_read() was reading rel. humidity from line 1 and cloud cover from line 3 instead -> SW_SKY_read() is now reading as the input files are formatted 
generic.h (v11-v12)
10/22/2010	(drs)	replaced every occurence of F_DELTA, #define F_DELTA (10*FLT_EPSILON), with ( max( 10.*FLT_EPSILON, FLT_EPSILON*pow(10., ceil(log10(max(fabs(x),max(fabs(y), FLT_EPSILON))+1.)) ) ) ) and similar for D_DELTA
					because earlier version worked only for 0<=x<fabs(31)


Comments:

SW_Sky.h
10/15/2009	(drs) the RealF transmission  in typedef struct SW_SKY is used as input in the call in SW_Flow.c from SW_Water_Flow(void) to petfunc(...),
			but the algorithm used in petfunc(...) in SW_Flow_lib.c cancels it out
				solrad = 917. * transcoeff
               			* (ahou * sin(rlat) *sin(declin)
                  		+ cos(rlat) *cos(declin) *sin(ahou));
				shwave = solrad *.0168 / transcoeff;

(v14) check conservation of mass in water balance
- AET = sum(transp) + (sum(evap_soil) + evap_veg + evap_litt)
- inf_soil = (rain + snowmelt) - (intc_litt + intc_veg)
- swc.l1(today) = swc.l1(yesterday) + inf_soil + hydred.l1 - (lyrdrain.l1 + transp.l1 + evap_soil.l1)
  swc.li(today) = swc.li(yesterday) + lyrdrain.l(i-1) + hydred.li - (lyrdrain.li + transp.li + evap_soil.li)
  swc.llast(today) = swc.llast(yesterday) + lyrdrain.l(last-1) + hydred.llast - (deep.drain + transp.llast + evap_soil.llast)
- daily: (rain + snowmelt) = AET + deep.drain + swc(today-yesterday) + litter(intc-evap) + veg(intc-evap)
  yearly: (rain + snowmelt) = AET + deep.drain + sum(swc(today-yesterday)) + litter(intc-evap) + veg(intc-evap)
  
- fix AET
SW_Flow.c
01/04/2011	(drs) added snowmelt to h2o_for_soil after interception, otherwise last day of snowmelt (when snowpack is gone) wasn't made available and aet became too small

- fix water balance
SW_Flow_lib.c
01/06/2011	(drs) drainout is calculated in 1. infiltrate_water_high() and 2. infiltrate_water_low(), but was not added up -> fixed it by changing '(*drainout) = drainlw' to '(*drainout) += drainlw' in function infiltrate_water_low()
01/06/2011	(drs) drainlw was not set to 0. in the for-loop, i.e. a layer with swc below pwp inherited incorrectly drainlw from layer above instead of drainlw=0
SW_Output.c
01/06/2011	(drs) changed all floating-point output from %7.4f to %7.6f to avoid rounding errors in post-run output calculations 
SW_Flow.c
01/06/2011	(drs) layer drainage was incorrectly calculated if hydraulic redistribution pumped water into a layer below pwp such that its swc was finally higher than pwp -> fixed it by first calculating hydraulic redistribution and then as final step infiltrate_water_low()
01/06/2011	(drs) call to infiltrate_water_low() has to be the last swc affecting calculation
			

- track snowloss and add to output

01/05/2011	(drs) removed unused variable *p from MkDir()
SW_Weather.c
01/05/2011	(drs) removed unused variables rain and snow from SW_WTH_new_day()

-change from gcc --target=i686-apple-darwin9 to --target=i686-apple-darwin10: at runtime "Abort trap" during call to get_temp() from SW_Output[k].pfunc() in SW_Output.c
SW_Output.c
01/05/2011	(drs) made typecast explicit: changed in SW_OUT_write_today(): SW_Output[k].pfunc() to ((void (*)(void))SW_Output[k].pfunc)(); -> doesn't solve problem under darwin10
				-> 'abort trap' was due to str[OUTSTRLEN] being too short (OUTSTRLEN 18), changed to OUTSTRLEN 100
				
				
(v15) fixing leap year calculations for end.year = 2000
gen_funcs.c
2011/01/27	(drs) renamed from "gen_funcs.c" to "generic.c"

2011/01/27	(drs) undocumented feature; changed "365	# ending day of last year" to  "end	# ending day of last year (either doy = {1, 366} or end)"

SW_Model.c
2011/01/27	(drs) when 'ending day of last year' in years.in was set to 366 and 'last year' was not a leap year, SoilWat would still calculate 366 days for the last (non-leap) year
				improved code to calculate SW_Model.endend in SW_MDL_read() in case strcmp(enddyval, "end")!=0 with
					d = atoi(enddyval);
					m->endend = (d < 365) ? d : Time_get_lastdoy_y(m->endyr);

(v17) AET: included snowloss; fixed forest evaporation, added forest litter; compiled with -fast optimization (apple only option)
SW_Flow.c
	02/22/2011	(drs) init aet for the day in SW_Water_Flow(), instead implicitely in evap_litter_veg()
	02/22/2011	(drs) added snowloss to AET

SW_Flow_lib.c
	02/22/2011	(drs) evap_litter_veg() set aet implicitely to 0. and then added litter evap; changed such that litter evap is now added to whatever value aet has previously

	02/22/2011	(drs) if TypeGrassOrShrub is turned off, then its biomass, litter, etc. values are set to 0



(v18) HD: Hydraulic Redistribution didn't output deepest layer for weekly, monthly and yearly output

SW_SoilWater.c
	01/20/2012	(drs)	in function 'SW_SnowDepth': catching division by 0 if snowdensity is 0

(v21) Role of SWCmin and SWCwp:
	- unsaturated percolation drains soils down to SWCmin which can be layer specific and calculated after Rawls WJ, Brakensiek DL (1985) Prediction of soil water properties for hydrological modeling. In Watershed management in the Eighties (eds Jones EB, Ward TJ), pp. 293-299. American Society of Civil Engineers, New York.
	- soil evaporation extracts water down to 0.5 * SWC at -1.5 MPa (according to FAO-56, e.g., Burt CM, Mutziger AJ, Allen RG, Howell TA (2005) Evaporation Research: Review and Interpretation. Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 131, 37-58.; or Torres EA, Calera A (2010) Bare soil evaporation under high evaporation demand: a proposed modification to the FAO-56 model. Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques, 55, 303-315.)
	- transpiration extracts water down to a SWC at a vegetation type specific critical SWP

unsaturated percolation:
SW_Flow_lib.c
	01/28/2011	(drs)	unsaturated flow drains now to swcmin instead of swcwp: changed infiltrate_water_low() accordingly

layer specific calculated SWCmin:
SW_SoilWater.h
	02/03/2012	(drs)	added function 'RealD SW_SWC_SWCres(RealD sand, RealD clay, RealD porosity)': which calculates 'Brooks-Corey' residual volumetric soil water based on Rawls & Brakensiek (1985)

SW_SoilWater.c
	02/03/2012	(drs)	added function 'RealD SW_SWC_SWCres(RealD sand, RealD clay, RealD porosity)': which calculates 'Brooks-Corey' residual volumetric soil water based on Rawls & Brakensiek (1985)

SW_Site.c
	02/03/2012	(drs)	if input of SWCmin < 0 then estimate SWCmin with 'SW_SWC_SWCres' for each soil layer


soil evaporation:
SW_Flow.c
	02/03/2012	(drs)	added 'lyrHalfWiltpts' = 0.5 * SWC at -1.5 MPa 
						soil evaporation extracts water down to 'lyrHalfWiltpts' (instead lyrSWCmin) according to the FAO-56 model, e.g., Burt CM, Mutziger AJ, Allen RG, Howell TA (2005) Evaporation Research: Review and Interpretation. Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 131, 37-58.


transpiration extracts water down to a SWC at a vegetation type specific critical SWP
SW_Flow.c
	01/28/2011	(drs)	transpiration can only extract water from soil down to lyrWiltpts (instead lyrSWCmin)
	02/04/2012	(drs)	added 'lyrSWCatSWPcrit_xx' for each vegetation type
						transpiration can only remove water from soil down to 'lyrSWCatSWPcrit_xx' (instead lyrSWCmin)
SW_Flow_lib.c
	02/04/2012	(drs)	in 'remove_from_soil': control that swc_avail >= 0

SW_VegProd.h
	02/04/2012	(drs)	added variable RealD SWPcrit to struct VegType: critical soil water potential below which vegetation cannot sustain transpiration */
SW_VegProd.c
	02/04/2012	(drs)	added input in SW_VPD_read() of RealD SWPcrit

SW_Site.h
	02/04/2012	(drs)	added RealD swc_atSWPcrit_xx for each vegetation type (tree, shrub, grass) to struct SW_LAYER_INFO: swc at the critical soil water potential

						added vwc/swc at SWPcrit to '_echo_inputs()'

SW_Control.c
 	02/04/2012	(drs)	in function '_read_inputs()' moved order of 'SW_VPD_read' from after 'SW_VES_read' to before 'SW_SIT_read': SWPcrit is read in in 'SW_VPD_read' and then calculated SWC_atSWPcrit is assigned to each layer in 'SW_SIT_read'



(v22) Percolation fixed: top soil layer had no unsaturated percolation

SW_Flow_lib.c
	03/26/2012	(drs)	infiltrate_water_low(): allow unsaturated percolation in first layer

 Hydraulic redistribution excluded from top soil layer
		 "the HR-induced moisture flux to the topsoil layer (0– 1.5 cm) is set to 0." (Wang et al. 2011 WRR 47)
		 "HR does not transport water to the soil immediately near the land surface because many shallow roots (e.g., in the top 5 cm of the soil) die in very dry soils [Ryel et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2005]. Therefore for flux to the top soil layer, the term qHR is set to zero." (Zheng et al. 2007 Journal of Geophysical Research-Biogeosciences 112)

SW_Flow_lib.c
	03/23/2012	(drs)	excluded hydraulic redistribution from top soil layer (assuming that this layer is <= 5 cm deep)




(v23) Soil temperature

NOTE: The equation for soil temperature DOESN'T work for big biomass values, values of like 15000 say, (ie trees) very well

SW_Flow_lib.c
	05/24/2012  (DLM) started writing soil_temperature function
	05/25/2012  (DLM) added all this 'fun' crazy linear regression stuff to soil_temperature function
	05/29/2012  (DLM) linear regression stuff in soil_temperature should work now, function needs testing
	05/30/2012  (DLM) got rid of nasty segmentation fault error in soil_temperature function, also tested math seems correct after checking by hand.  added the ability to change the value of deltaX
	05/30/2012  (DLM) added soil_temp_error variable... it simply keeps track of whether or not an error has been reported in the soil_temperature function.  0 for no, 1 for yes.
	05/30/2012  (DLM) added # of lyrs check & maxdepth check at the beginning of soil_temperature function to make sure code doesn't blow up... if there isn't enough lyrs (ie < 2) or the maxdepth is too little (ie < deltaX * 2), the function quits out and reports an error to the user
	05/31/2012  (DLM) added theMaxDepth variable to soil_temperature function to allow the changing of the maxdepth of the equation	
	05/31/2012  (DLM) added soil_temperature_init() function for use in the soil_temperature function to initialize the values for use in the regressions... it is not apart of the header file, because it's not meant to be an external function
	05/31/2012  (DLM) soil_temperature() function now stores most regression data in a structure to reduce redundant regression calculations & speeds things up
	06/01/2012  (DLM) edited soil_temperature function(), changed deltaT variable from hours to seconds, also changed some of the regression calculations so that swc, fc, & wp regressions are scaled properly... results are actually starting to look usable!
	06/13/2012  (DLM) soil_temperature function no longer extrapolates values for regression layers that are out of the bounds of the soil layers... instead they are now set to the last soil layers values.  extrapolating code is still in the function and can be commented out and used if wishing to go back to extrapolating the values...

SW_Flow_lib.h
	05/25/2012  (DLM) added function soil_temperature to header file
	05/31/2012  (DLM) added ST_RGR_VALUES struct to keep track of variables used in the soil_temperature function

	05/25/2012  (DLM) edited _read_layers( void) function to read in the initial soil temperature for each layer
	05/25/2012  (DLM) edited _echo_inputs( void) function to echo the read initial soil temperatures for each layer
	05/30/2012  (DLM) edited _read_layers & _echo_inputs functions to read in/echo the deltaX parameter
	05/31/2012  (DLM) edited _read_layers & _echo_inputs functions to read in/echo stMaxDepth & use_soil_temp variables
	05/31/2012  (DLM) edited _init_site_info(void) to check if stMaxDepth & stDeltaX values are usable, if not it resets them to the defaults (180 & 15).
	
SW_Site.h
	05/24/2012  (DLM) added variables for Soil Temperature constants to SW_SITE struct

	05/25/2012  (DLM) added sTemp[MAX_LAYERS] var to SW_SOILWAT_OUTPUTS struct & SW_SOILWAT struct to keep track of the soil temperatures 
	
SW_Output.c
	05/25/2012  (DLM) added SW_SOILTEMP to keytostr, updated keytoobj;  wrote get_soiltemp(void) function, added code in the _construct() function to link to get_soiltemp() correctly;  added code to sumof and average_for() to handle the new key
	05/25/2012  (DLM) added a few lines of nonsense to sumof_ves() function in order to get rid of the annoying compiler warnings

(v24) Updated PET
SW_Flow_lib.c
	10/11/2012	(drs)	annotated all equations;
					replaced unknown equation for solar declination with one by Spencer (1971);
					replaced unknown equation for 'Slope of the Saturation Vapor Pressure-Temperature Curve' = arads with one provided by Allen et al. (1998) and (2005);
					replaced constant psychrometric constant (0.27 [mmHg/F]) as function of pressure, and pressure as function of elevation of site (Allen et al. (1998) and (2005));
					windspeed data is in [m/s] and not in code-required [miles/h] -> fixed conversation factor so that code now requires [m/s];
					replaced conversion addend from C to K (previously, 273) with 273.15;
					updated solar constant from S = 2.0 [ly/min] to S = 1.952 [ly/min] (Kopp et al. 2011) in the equation to calculate solrad;
					replaced unknown numerical factor of 0.201 in black-body long wave radiation to sigma x conversion-factor = 0.196728 [mm/day/K4];
					--> further update suggestions:
						- add Seller's factor '(mean(d)/d)^2' with (mean(d) = mean distance and d = instantaneous distance of the earth from the sun) to shortwave calculations


(v25) Adjust PET for topography (slope, aspect)
SW_Flow_lib.c
	11/06/2012	(clk)	allowed slope and aspect to be used in the calculation for solar radiation;
					if slope is 0, will still use old equation,
					else will sum up Seller (1965), page 35, eqn. 3.15 from sunrise to sunset.	


(v26) Added percentage of runoff loss per day
SW_Weather.h
	11/30/2012	(clk) added variable 'surfaceRunoff' to SW_WEATHER and SW_WEATHER_OUTPUTS
					changed 'runoff' to 'snowRunoff' to better distinguish between surface runoff and snowmelt runoff
SW_Weather.c
	11/30/2010	(clk) added appopriate lines for 'surfaceRunoff' in SW_WTH_new_year() and SW_WTH_new_day()

SW_Flow.c
	11/30/2012	(clk)	added lines to calculate the surface runoff and to adjust the surface water level based on that value

SW_Site.h
	11/30/2010	(clk)	added the variable 'percentRunoff' which is the percent of surface water that is lost do to surface runoff

SW_Site.c
	11/30/2012	(clk)	In SW_SIT_read(void), added lines to read in percentRunoff from siteparam.in
	11/30/2012	(clk)	In _echo_inputs(void), added lines to echo percentRunoff to logfile

SW_Output.c
	11/30/2012	(clk)	changed get_surfaceWater() to ouput amound of surface water, surface runoff, and snowmelt runoff, respectively.
	12/13/2012	(clk, drs)	changed get_surfaceWater() to output amount of surface water
						added get_runoff() to output surface runoff, and snowmelt runoff, respectively, in a separate file -> new version of outsetupin
						updated key2str and OutKey
	12/14/2012 (drs)	changed OUTSTRLEN from 2000 to 3000 to prevent 'Abort trap: 6' at runtime

SW_Output.h
	12/13/2012	(clk) added SW_RUNOFF, updated SW_OUTNKEYs to 29, added eSW_Runoff to enum
	12/14/2012	(drs) updated SW_OUTNKEYs from 29 to 26 [incorrect number probably introduced 09/12/2011]

(v27) Allowed all time steps to be output
SW_Output.h
	01/10/2013	(clk)	instead of using one FILE pointer named fp, created four new 
					FILE pointers; fp_dy, fp_wk, fp_mo, and fp_yr. This allows us to keep track
					of all time steps for each OutKey. 

SW_Output.c
	01/10/2013	(clk)	in function SW_OUT_read, when creating the output files, needed to loop through this four times
					for each OutKey, giving us the output files for day, week, month, and year. Also, added
					a switch statement to acqurie the dy, wk, mo, or yr suffix based on the iteration of the for loop.
					When reading in lines from outsetup, removed PERIOD from the read in because it is unneeded in since
					we are doing all time steps.
					Removed the line SW_Output[k].period = str2period(Str_ToUpper(period, ext)), since we are no longer
					reading in a period.
				in function SW_OUT_close_files need to loop through and close all four time step files for each
					OutKey, determined which file to close based on the iteration of the for loop.
				in function SW_OUT_write_today needed to loop through the code four times for each OutKey, changing
					the period of the output for each iteration. With the for loop, I am also able to pick the
					proper FILE pointer to choose when outputting the data.
				in function average_for needed to loop through the code four times for each OutKey, changing
					the period of the output for each iteration.
				the function str2period is no longer used in the code, but will leave it in the code for now.
	01/17/2013	(clk)	in function SW_OUT_read, created an additional condition that if the keyname was TIMESTEP,
					the code would rescan the line looking for up to 5 strings. The first one would be saved 
					back into keyname, while the other four would be stored in a matrix. These values would be
					the desired timesteps to output. Then you would convert these strings to periods, and store 
					them in an array of integers and keep track of how many timesteps were actually read in.
				The other changes are modifications of the changes made on 01/10/2013. For all the for loops, instead of 
					looping through 4 times, we now loop through for as many times as periods that we read in from the
					TIMESTEP line. Also, in all the switch cases where we increased that value which changed the period
					to the next period, we now use the array of integers that stored the period and move through that with
					each iteration.

Input Files
	01/10/2013	(clk)	Since we are now doing all time steps at the same time, there is no need for four different files.in and outsetup.in,
				therefore, reduced those four into one file.
	01/17/2013	(clk)	In the file outsetup.in added the line:
					TIMESTEP __ __ __ __, where __ is where the desired periods to output would be placed,
					can use all four or just one, so for example,
					TIMESTEP dy yr would output just the daily and yearly results.
