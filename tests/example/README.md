# SOILWAT2 example inputs

You can change the files and their content locally for testing purposes. However, do not
push your local changes to the repository.

Our other repositories (STEPWAT2, rSOILWAT2, and rSFSW2) depend on these input files and
their content for their testing purposes.

If you change these files and/or their content because SOILWAT2 gained input parameters
and/or produced new output, then you should check and update the dependent repositories.
