#------ Input file for the spatial and temporal domain

# A domain describes a set of related simulation runs

# USER: years must be consistent with `weathsetup.in`, `carbon.in`,
#       and (if used) `swcsetup.in`.
# NOTE: This file follows a key-value pair. That is, the value is only matched with the key
# eliminating the possibility of incorrect reads due to line dependencies.

Domain    s                     # Supported types: "xy" (grid), "s" (sites)
nDimX     1                     # Number of grid cells along x dimension (used if "xy")
nDimY     1                     # Number of grid cells along y dimension (used if "xy")
nDimS     20                     # Number of sites (used if "s")

StartYear 1980                  # First (Gregorian) calendar year of simulation
