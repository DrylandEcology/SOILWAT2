#------ Input file for domain/time of the simulation

# USER: years must be consistent with `weathsetup.in`, `carbon.in`,
#       and (if used) `swcsetup.in`.
# NOTE: This file follows a key-value pair. That is, the value is only matched with the key
# eliminating the possibility of incorrect reads due to line dependancies.
