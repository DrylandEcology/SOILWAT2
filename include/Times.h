/*  Source file: Times.h
 *  Type: header
 *
 *  Purpose: Provides a consistent definition for the
 *           time values that might be needed by various
 *           objects.
 *  History:
 *    9/11/01 -- INITIAL CODING - cwb  Originally coded to
 *          be used in SOILWAT.
 *
 *    12/02 -- IMPORTANT CHANGE -- cwb
 *          After modifying the code to integrate with STEPPE
 *          I found that the old system of starting most
 *          arrays from 1 (aka base1) was causing more problems
 *          than it was worth, so I modified all the arrays and
 *          times and other indices to start from 0 (aka base0).
 *          The basic logic is that the user will see base1
 *          numbers while the code will use base0.  Unfortunately
 *          this will require careful attention to the points
 *          at which the conversions must be made, eg, month
 *          indices read from a file will be base1 as will
 *          such times that appear in the output.
 *
 * 2/14/03 - cwb - the features of this code appear to be
 *          rather generally useful, so I took out the
 *          soilwat specific stuff and made a general
 *          codeset.
 *
 * 2/24/03 - cwb - Moved Doy2Month to a function in Times.c
 *
 *    19-Sep-03 (cwb) Imported a bunch of new routines
 *       and added the facility for model time.
 *	  09/26/2011	(drs)	added function interpolate_monthlyValues()
